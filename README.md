# About the Project
The stakeholders of this project are a newly established office supply store and would like to know which products are bringing in the most revenue, comparing each product by the years that they have been operating for (2020-2023). The clients are looking for comparisons of total sales, profit, and total quantity sold each year. The clients are also concerned with what category in sales they need to remove as they are not seeing much growth in the upcoming year (technology, furniture, or office supplies). The stakeholders have made it clear that it is important for the dashboard to be dynamic and user friendly as they will be using this sole dashboard for their upcoming meetings with their suppliers and other business partners.

### The Objective
- Make a user-friendly, interactive, and dynamic dashboard for the clients to utilise and view 
- compare current year vs. previous year sales, profits, and total quantity sold each year
- create graph by category, sub-category, and product name to see the most sold and profitable items
- To make data driven decisions in the business in order to maximize efficiency and minimize the most amount of costs possible

### The Findings:
- While the total amount of sales each year is increasing, the total profits per year is not necessarily increasing in 2020-2021:

  ### 2020-2021
 From 2020-2021, the profits were severely low in compared to the total amount of sales occuring in those years. Especially comparing 2021 (current year sales) vs. 2020 (previous year sales), the profits in 2021 were significantly low considering the amount of sales happening. The total quantity sold in 2021 had increased significantly, yet shows that the products being sold are not the most profitable when looking at the total profits. When looking at the most sold product during 2020-2021, it was the GBC DocuBind TL300 Electric Binding System. However this product was eating at the profits as the profit margin for this product is extremely low, resulting in a negative profit of -1,030. 

 ### 2021-2022 
 The profits, total sales, and total quantity sold increased significantly when comparing to it's previous year. Even when considering the total profits in 2022, it was up 476.54% when compared to last year! Wow! The most sold product that was introduced in 2022 was the Canon 2200 Advanced Copier. This newly introduced product brought sales up by 92.27% compared to it's previous year, meaning that this copier is a highly valued and sought after product in the office supply industry! It would be highly beneficial for the company to keep this product in stock and to introduce new models of the copier to it's customers, depending on their budget and purpose!

 ### 2022-2023 
 The store displays good growth as a more established business at this point. They kept the Canon 2200 Advanced Copier, which is still the most sold and sought after product at this shop! However, the shop sold more units of the copier this year than last year. This profit margin for the copier is still large, making it a very good product to keep in stock. Although the total sales have increased in 2023 compared to 2022, there was a large loss of sales in the month of August. There can be many factors that can contribute to this (market, amount of customers, holidays, products in stock or out of stock). 

 ### Sales Categories 
 In all of the years, furniture was the least profitable category as it had a very small profit margin for all of the years. Although some of the top selling products are tables and chairs, it does not produce enough profit for it to be possible to keep these products around in stock. Small items such as the Martin Envelope Opener are popular items as well, but they do not have a large profit margin. Yet it would be beneficial to keep these small products around as add-ons near the checkout lane. 

### Sales by Month 
Sales usually increase significantly around September and October for all of the years. This can be due to students (primary, high-school, university) and/or their parents purchasing school supplies for the new year. Sales also increase around November and December, indicating that many of the products may be gifted as a Christmas gift or purchased during high volume days like Boxing Day and Black Friday. 

  ## The Strategy
- Keep high ticket items like the Canon 2200 Advanced Copier as the profit margins are large and are highly sought after products by customers. Keep extra stock of these high ticket items during high volume holidays like Boxing Day and Black Friday to sell more.
- Keep the current model of the Canon 2200 Advanced Copier and also have newly release models or other alternatives for photo copiers. Newly released models of the Canon 2200 may have newer features that may suit the needs of a highly technological company/person. Newer features may include bluetooth technology, touch screen model, and better printing. This can be a good product if the customer values these newer features and are willing to spend more for it. For customers who may not need these newer features and prefer a simpler model will have other alternatives to choose from in the store. This way, the store is suiting the needs of a wider audience rather than just focusing on one product for one particular demographic.
- Remove current models of furniture and replace them with more profitable products. The current products in the shop are not generating enough revenue for the company since the profit margin is extremely low. The company would have to either change their current supplier or have more profitable furniture in stock. Some of the more profitable furniture could be a memory foam gaming chair with a head rest or a desk with multiple drawers and working space. But it is important to not get rid of the furniture category as chairs and tables were the most sold product in 2023! 
- Keep small products near the check out lane or create a check out lane with containers around the cash. The second most sold product in 2023 was an electric letter opener. Although it doesn't have a large profit margin, it can be a great add-on to a customer's current purchase to drive up the ATV (Average Transaction Value) and UPT (Unit Per Transaction). These key metrics are crucial in driving up sales for the year!
- Have promotional campaigns during high volume months such as September for back to school, November for Black Friday, and December for Christmas and Boxing Day. These campaigns can be lowered/discounted priced products and lower prices for purchases with two or more products!
